// taller than the widget's default 300px (e.g. the config panel) grow the
// window instead of scrolling internally.
//
// `enabled` is a real dependency of the effect, not a convenience flag: the
// caller needs to be able to switch this measurement off entirely while
// something else owns the window size (App.tsx's Recording/Processing pill).
// Detaching the ref is not enough to do that. Once the ResizeObserver below
// exists it keeps observing the elements it was handed, whatever `ref.current`
// later becomes, so every step of the pill's resize animation would change the
// observed content box, re-fire measure(), and set the window straight back to
// `width` x content height. Turning `enabled` off tears the observer down;
// turning it back on re-creates it, and ResizeObserver.observe() fires an
// initial callback that re-measures the content immediately.
